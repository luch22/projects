## Learning objectives

## The mission

![desktop preview](./desktop-preview.jpg)

You've been asked to implement a design for a newly created agency.

The graphic designer gave you all the elements so you can code the thing yourself. You have 2 days, but with the power of flexboxes and grids you should be able to make it!

- The [desktop design](./resources/desktop-design.jpg) end product should match this image
- The [mobile design](./resources/mobile-design.jpg) end product should match this image
- You don't need to implement the burger menu on the mobile view yet, just focus on the rest of the elements. Do it as a bonus once the rest is done. 

Good luck!
